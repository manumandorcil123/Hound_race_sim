Greyhound Race Simulator
Author: Manu Dorcil
Date: 08 May 2025
Language: C# (.NET Framework)
Project Type: Console Application
Purpose: Simulates a greyhound dog race with visual progress and ranking.

ðŸŽ¯ Description
This program simulates a race between 6 to 8 user-named greyhounds. Users choose a race type (sprint, middle distance, or marathon), and the race is simulated round-by-round with randomly generated performance values.

Each round displays a live graph of each dog's progress using a visual star (*) system. At the end, the top 3 finishers are announced. The user has the option to restart and run another race without closing the program.

ðŸ›  Features
Input validation for number of dogs and race type.

Three race lengths:

Sprint: 6 rounds

Middle Distance: 10 rounds

Marathon: 12 rounds

Random scoring system per dog, per round.

Live visual feedback using stars * to represent total score/progress.

Displays total score per dog.

Ranks and announces top 3 finishers.

Option to run multiple races in a single session.

ðŸ§ª How to Run
Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.

Build and run the program.

Follow the console prompts to:

Enter number of dogs (6â€“8)

Name each dog

Select race type

Watch the race progress

At the end, choose whether to race again.

âœ… Requirements Met
âœ… User can run new races without restarting the program.

âœ… Live race graph with visual progress per dog (scaled star chart).

âœ… Valid input handling for dog count and race type.

âœ… 1D and 2D arrays for dynamic data storage.

âœ… Logical flow with loops, conditions, and sorting.

Educational Purpose
This project was developed to demonstrate:

Control flow (loops, conditionals)

Arrays and multi-dimensional data

Random number generation

Basic console UI and text-based graphics

Object-oriented logic structuring (basic)
